### R and RStudio

* R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. After installing both programs, you will need to install 
some specific R packages within RStudio. Follow the instructions below for
your operating system, and then follow the instructions to install
**`tidyverse`** and **`RSQLite`**.

#### Windows

> ## If you already have R and RStudio installed
>
> * Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
> available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
> * To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
>  that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are
>  running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display
>  which version of R you are running. Go on
>  the <a href= "https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">[CRAN website</a> and check
> whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  > it. You can <a href= "https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f">check here</a> for
> more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.
>
> * Follow the steps in the instructions for everyone at the
>   bottom of this page.

> ## If you don't have R and RStudio installed
>
> * Download R from
>  the <a href= "https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">CRAN website</a>.
> * Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
> * Go to the <a href= "https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download page</a>
> * Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows Vista/7/8/10** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
> * Double click the file to install it
> * Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
> error messages
>
> * Follow the steps in the instructions for everyone at the
>   bottom of this page.

#### macOS

> ## If you don't have R and RStudio installed
>
> * Download R from
>   the <a href= "https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">CRAN website</a>.
> * Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
> * Double click on the downloaded file to install R
> * It is also a good idea to install <a href= "https://www.xquartz.org/">XQuartz</a> (needed
>   by some packages)
> * Go to the <RStudio download page]()
> * Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
>   (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)

#### Linux

* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from <a href= "https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux">CRAN</a>, they provide information
 to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most
 distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
 `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we
 don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
 usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.5.1.
* Go to the <a href= "https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download
  page</a>
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
   install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i
   rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
   error messages.
  * Follow the steps in the instructions for everyone


#### For everyone

* After installing R and RStudio, you need to install the `tidyverse` and
`RSQLite` packages. Start RStudio by double-clicking the icon and then type:
  `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "RSQLite"))`. You can also do this by going to Tools -> Install Packages and 
  typing the names of the packages you want to install, separated by a comma.
  
## Download the data
We will download the data directly from R during the lessons. However, if you are expecting problems with the network, it may be better to download the data beforehand and store it on your machine.

The data files for the lesson can be downloaded manually here: <a href= "https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459</a>.
